# Progress Logic Unification Test

## Changes Made

### 1. HabitCard Component
- ✅ Updated to use `goal` instead of `isMultiStep`/`totalSteps`
- ✅ Unified progress logic: `isMultiGoal = goal > 1`
- ✅ Added "Steps Today" label and X / Goal counter for multi-goal habits
- ✅ Applied success tint (#DCFCE7) when done
- ✅ Undo button only shows when progress is between 1 and Goal-1
- ✅ All animations use 300ms ease-in-out timing

### 2. HabitStatusControls Component
- ✅ Applied success tint (#DCFCE7) to Done badge
- ✅ Undo button only shows when progress is between 1 and Goal-1
- ✅ All animations use 300ms ease-in-out timing

### 3. Progress Component
- ✅ Updated to use 300ms ease-in-out timing for consistency

### 4. Dashboard Component
- ✅ Removed deprecated `isMultiStep`/`totalSteps` props
- ✅ Now passes only `goal` and `currentStep`

## Expected Behavior

### Multi-Goal Habits (Goal > 1)
- Dashboard cards show "Steps Today" label with X / Goal counter
- Progress bar reflects exact ratio (X ÷ Goal × 100%)
- Mark button increments until reaching Goal, then switches to Done with #DCFCE7 tint
- Undo button appears only when progress is between 1 and Goal-1
- Both Dashboard cards and Habits table show identical X / Goal format

### Single-Goal Habits (Goal = 1)
- Remain binary: Mark / Done only
- Progress shows as percentage
- No step counter displayed

### Animation Consistency
- All progress transitions use 300ms ease-in-out
- Button interactions have consistent timing
- Progress bars animate smoothly on updates

## Test Cases

1. **Water habit (Goal: 8, Current: 5)**
   - Should show "5 / 8" in both card and table
   - Progress bar at 62.5%
   - Mark button available
   - Undo button visible

2. **Exercise habit (Goal: 1, Completed)**
   - Should show "Done" with success tint
   - Progress bar at 100%
   - No undo in table (binary habit)

3. **Vitamins habit (Goal: 3, Current: 1)**
   - Should show "1 / 3" in both views
   - Progress bar at 33.3%
   - Mark button available
   - Undo button visible

4. **Reading habit (Goal: 1, Not started)**
   - Should show "Mark" button
   - Progress bar at 0%
   - No undo button

All components now use unified logic with consistent visual and interaction patterns.
